-- Step 4: Mart - Create skills demand mart (dimensional mart)
-- Run this after Step 3
-- This mart focuses on skills demand over time with clean additive measures

-- Drop existing mart schema if it exists (for idempotency)
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS skills_mart CASCADE;

-- Step 1: Create the mart schema
CREATE SCHEMA skills_mart;

-- Step 2: Create dimension tables

    type VARCHAR

INSERT INTO skills_mart.dim_skill (skill_id, skills, type)

    skills,
    type

-- 2. Month-level date dimension (enhanced with quarter and other attributes)
